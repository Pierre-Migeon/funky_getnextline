I am recoding the early 42 projects to bring my C programming skills back up to speed. This is a version of the project "Get_next_line" which reads in the entire file from the filedescriptor the first time it is called, and then returns one line at a time each time that it is called. I had heard that this was one way of writing the program, and wanted to try it out. Although it seems a bit memory intensive compared to storing what comes just past the line read between calls to the function, it does work. See the other two versions of getnextline for versions that do not use this method.
